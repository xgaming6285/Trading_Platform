Design Decisions
This document outlines the key architectural and design decisions made during the development of the Cryptocurrency Trading Simulator.

1. Architecture Overview
    1.1 Frontend Architecture
        ♦Framework: React with TypeScript
            ♦Rationale: Strong type safety, better developer experience, and excellent component reusability      
            ♦Benefits: Reduced runtime errors, better maintainability, and improved code organization
        ♦State Management: React Hooks + Context
            ♦Rationale: Avoided Redux due to application size and complexity level
            ♦Benefits: Simpler codebase, easier testing, and reduced boilerplate
    1.2 Backend Architecture
        ♦Framework: Spring Boot
            ♦Rationale: Robust, well-documented, and excellent WebSocket support
            ♦Benefits: Quick development, good performance, and extensive ecosystem

2. Real-time Data Handling
    2.1 WebSocket Implementation
        ♦Decision: Custom WebSocket service with automatic reconnection
        ♦Rationale:
            ♦Needed reliable real-time price updates
            ♦Required handling network interruptions gracefully
        ♦Implementation Details:
            ♦Reconnection attempts with exponential backoff
            ♦Health check mechanism to detect stale connections
            ♦Message queue for handling backpressure
    2.2 Price Update Strategy
        ♦Approach: Differential updates
        ♦Rationale: Minimize data transfer and improve performance
        ♦Implementation:
            ♦Only send price changes that exceed threshold
            ♦Batch updates when possible
            ♦Periodic full state sync for consistency

3. Data Storage
    3.1 In-Memory Storage
        ♦Decision: Used in-memory storage with periodic snapshots
        ♦Rationale:
            ♦Simulation nature of application
            ♦Performance requirement
            ♦Simplicity of implementation
        ♦Trade-offs:
            ♦Data persistence not guaranteed
            ♦Limited by available memory
            ♦Suitable for demonstration purposes
    3.2 Data Models
        ♦Approach: Immutable data structures where possible
        ♦Benefits:
            ♦Thread safety
            ♦Predictable state changes
            ♦Easier debugging

4. Security Considerations
    4.1 API Security
        ♦Decision: Basic CORS and rate limiting
        ♦Rationale: Demonstration application with no sensitive data
        ♦Note: Production implementation would require
            ♦Authentication
            ♦Authorization
            ♦API key management
            ♦Request signing

5. Error Handling
    5.1 Strategy
        ♦Approach: Centralized error handling
        ♦Implementation:
            ♦Global error boundary in React
            ♦Controller advice in Spring Boot
            ♦Consistent error response format
        ♦Benefits:
            ♦Consistent error reporting
            ♦Easier debugging
            ♦Better user experience

6. Testing Strategy
    6.1 Frontend Testing
        ♦Approach: Component testing with React Testing Library
        ♦Coverage:
            ♦Component rendering
            ♦User interactions
            ♦State management
            ♦API integration
    6.2 Backend Testing
        ♦Approach: Multi-layer testing strategy
        ♦Implementation:
            ♦Unit tests for business logic
            ♦Integration tests for API endpoints
            ♦WebSocket connection tests
            ♦Load testing for concurrent users

7. Performance Optimizations
    7.1 Frontend Optimizations
        ♦React.memo for expensive components
        ♦Virtualization for long lists
        ♦Debounced API calls
        ♦Optimistic UI updates
    7.2 Backend Optimizations
        ♦Connection pooling
        ♦Caching frequently accessed data
        ♦Batch processing where applicable
        ♦Efficient data structures for price lookups

8. Future Considerations
    8.1 Scalability
        ♦Implement horizontal scaling
        ♦Add load balancing
        ♦Consider message queue for trade processing
        ♦Implement database sharding
    8.2 Features
        ♦Historical data analysis
